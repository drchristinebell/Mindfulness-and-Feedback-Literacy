1
00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:09.759
Think of a situation in your life

2
00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.304
that is difficult
or that is causing you some stress.

3
00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:18.435
Call the situation to your mind.

4
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.605
You may even notice

5
00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:27.027
that you can actually feel the stress
and emotional discomfort in your body.

6
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.238
If so, that's okay.

7
00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:35.827
It's normal to feel discomfort
in difficult situations.

8
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:40.874
Once you have a situation in your mind,
say to yourself,

9
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.794
This is a moment of suffering.

10
00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.755
Just noticing that you're struggling in

11
00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:50.175
this moment is mindfulness.

12
00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:53.219
Other options
that you could say to yourself include:

13
00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:57.098
"this hurts".

14
00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:00.101
"Ouch".

15
00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.104
"This is stressful".

16
00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:07.150
In this first step, mindfulness,

17
00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:10.695
we are noticing and acknowledging
that something is hard.

18
00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:12.906
That's it.

19
00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:16.493
And we can use whatever language
or wording that resonates

20
00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:20.205
and matches your experience.

21
00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:24.375
Next, we acknowledge
that suffering is a part of life.

22
00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:26.711
That's common humanity.

23
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.047
You could say to

24
00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:32.425
yourself: "other
people feel this way, too".

25
00:01:34.177 --> 00:01:36.304
"I'm not alone".

26
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.307
We all struggle in our lives.

27
00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.561
Now I invite you to try

28
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:48.358
putting your hands over your heart,
feeling the warmth of your hands,

29
00:01:48.691 --> 00:01:53.530
and the gentle touch of your hands
on your chest.

30
00:01:53.947 --> 00:01:58.076
Or adopt another soothing touch
that feels right for you.

31
00:01:58.827 --> 00:02:02.831
Maybe it's wrapping yourself in a hug.

32
00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:10.588
As you do this, say to yourself,

33
00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:13.466
"may I be kind to myself?"

34
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.555
This is the self kindness
component of self-compassion,

35
00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:21.349
the third component.

36
00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:24.310
You can also ask yourself,

37
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.230
What do I need to hear right now
to express

38
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.733
kindness to myself?

39
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.988
Is there a phrase that speaks to you
in your particular situation?

40
00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:37.115
Such as?

41
00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:40.243
May I give myself
the compassion that I need?

42
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.537
May I learn

43
00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:46.624
to accept myself as I am?

44
00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.669
May I be strong?

45
00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:54.465
May I be patient?

46
00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:59.137
And remember, you can adapt the wording
so that it feels genuine to you.

47
00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:03.391
I will give myself a break.

48
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:06.436
I will be strong.

49
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:10.607
I will work through this difficulty.

50
00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:15.403
I'm learning to accept myself as I am.

51
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:20.283
Use this practice
any time you need some self-compassion.

52
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.661
Remembering the three elements
of mindfulness,

53
00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.415
common humanity and self kindness.
