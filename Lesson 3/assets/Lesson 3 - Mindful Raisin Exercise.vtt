00:00:08.575 --> 00:00:09.542
That's okay.

3
00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:13.546
Try to experience the activity
with a child-like curiosity.

4
00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:16.683
Hold the raisin in between

your index finger and thumb.

6
00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.789
Imagine
that you've never seen a raisin before

7
00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.792
and give it your full attention.

8
00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.161
Focus on its shape,

9
00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:32.232
color and texture.

10
00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:38.071
Start moving the raisin between your fingers.

11
00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.875
Squeeze it a little and see how squishy

12
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.111
it is or isn't.

13
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.649
Maybe close your eyes to help you focus.

14
00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:56.089
Now hold the raisin under your nose
and take a sniff.

15
00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.125
What does it smell like?

16
00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.734
Pop the raisin in your mouth.

17
00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:11.671
Don't chew hold it in your mouth
for at least 10 seconds.

18
00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.810
Explore it with your tongue.

19
00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:20.914
Notice the texture and temperature.

20
00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:26.853
What does it feel like

21
00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:28.955
to wait before chewing?

22
00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:37.931
When you're ready, start chewing.

23
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:42.735
Take one or two bites and give the taste
your full attention.

24
00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:47.474
Take your time and don't swallow.

25
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.050
Notice the taste and texture of the raisin
in your mouth

26
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.552
and how it changes over time.

27
00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:15.135
Now swallow
noticing the physical sensation.

28
00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:20.840
How do you feel now,

29
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.312
and what would your life be like

30
00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.549
if all of your meals were more like this?

31
00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:35.889
You may think

32
00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:40.260
this is a ridiculous amount of time
to give a piece of dried fruit.

33
00:02:40.793 --> 00:02:43.496
Do you feel a little silly?

34
00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:46.166
Is your mind wandering?

35
00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:49.202

but don't get distracted

36
00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.470
by them.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.240
