00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:05.939
To begin,

2
00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.575
I'll invite you to sit
in a comfortable position.

3
00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:12.979
Allow both soles of your feet
to connect to the floor,

4
00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:16.649
If that's possible for you.

5
00:00:17.017 --> 00:00:21.054
Rest your hands on your thighs
and let your shoulders drop.

6
00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:25.692
If you'd like,
you may gently close your eyes,

7
00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.928
Or if you prefer to keep them open,
you could gaze

8
00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.231
softly down.

9
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:33.266
Let your spine grow

10
00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:36.036
tall and noble like the trunk of a tree.

11
00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:39.639
We're aiming for a posture that is alert

12
00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:43.043
but still comfortable.

13
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.380
Take a moment to notice
how your body feels.

14
00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:51.484
If you notice any areas of tension,

15
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.920
see if you can gently release them.

16
00:00:58.792 --> 00:00:59.359
And now,

17
00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.430
bring your attention
to the flow of your breath.

18
00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.332
You don't need to breathe
in any special way.

19
00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:11.838
Your body knows how
to breathe all on it's own.

20
00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.641
Simply notice each

21
00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:19.112
breath coming into the body
within in breath and leaving the body

22
00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:21.347
with an out breath.

23
00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.853
Perhaps you notice your breath

24
00:01:26.853 --> 00:01:30.190
in and around your nose.

25
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.891
Perhaps you notice your breath

26
00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.861
more in your chest area, around your ribs.

27
00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.431
Perhaps you notice it around your stomach.

28
00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.768
You might feel your abdomen
moving with your inhale

29
00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.537
and your exhale.

30
00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:49.275
Just notice your breath
in whatever way is most prominent for you.

31
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.114
Not trying to change it, just noticing.

32
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.756
If you notice,
your mind is caught up in

33
00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:06.993
thoughts, emotions or body sensations,

34
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.662
know that this is normal.

35
00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:13.633
Simply notice what is distracting
you and gently let it go

36
00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.669
by redirecting your attention
back to the flow

37
00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.072
of your breath.

38
00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:31.050
As we prepare to end this
three-minute practice for today,

39
00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:34.554
take a few more mindful breaths.

40
00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:42.428
You may wish to wiggle your toes and your fingers,

41
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:48.368
move around a bit in your seat.

42
00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:49.936
And when you are ready,

43
00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:53.072
slowly open your eyes or return your gaze

44
00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:55.341
upward.

45
00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:59.879
And now, gently bring your attention
back to your surroundings,

46
00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:04.083
as you begin
to move on to the next part of your day.
