00:00:04.137 --> 00:00:06.206
Mindfulness can help support you

2
00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:09.943
any time
difficulty arises during your day.

3
00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:13.446
like the moments when you receive
some information or feedback

4
00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.449
that immediately propels you
to think the worst.

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.587
Or when you hear or see a comment
from someone that compels

6
00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:23.757
you to want to say or do something
that you might later regret.

7
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.560
This particular practice is based on one

8
00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.797
offered
by Rhonda McKee through mindful.org

9
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.867
Stop is a simple practice

10
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.137
that can help you to redirect
and get back on track

11
00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:41.041
when you're experiencing
overwhelming feelings or thoughts.

12
00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:44.210
The four letters in the words STOP

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.883
will help you remember how to do it.

14
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:54.721
Let's try it together now.

15
00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:56.923
To begin,

16
00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.793
The S stands simply for stop.

17
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.229
Literally just stop or pause.

18
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.431
What you're doing

19
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.367
whether it's typing a text or reading an email

20
00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.203
or rushing out the door
of your meeting or class.

21
00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.840
Give yourself a moment to come to rest.

22
00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:15.809
To pause.

23
00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:19.045
And to collect yourself.

24
00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:23.016
The T stands for

25
00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:26.853
Take a conscious breath.

26
00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:31.558
Now that you've paused,
take a deeper breath or two,

27
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:34.761
allowing yourself
to feel the expansion of the belly

28
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:37.931
as you breathe deeply.

29
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:42.102
Notice the sensations of being here now

30
00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:45.438
As you do so,

31
00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.508
It might help to bring your attention
to the sensations

32
00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:51.811
of your feet, meeting the floor,

33
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:53.880
feel the support of the ground

34
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.552
and of your own, relaxing breath
as you do so.

35
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.023
The O stands for Observe

36
00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.859
what's going on inside you,

37
00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.828
including any thoughts,

38
00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:10.296
emotions,

39
00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.632
or bodily sensations

40
00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:15.235
such as tension, butterflies,

41
00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:19.038
tightness in the jawline.

42
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.176
Now broaden your awareness
to take in the circumstances.

43
00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:27.046
Notice how you can be in this situation

44
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.351
without being ruled by it.

45
00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.554
For added support,

46
00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:37.790
offer yourself
some kindness and compassion

47
00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:40.894
as you release tension and stressful
thoughts.

48
00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.364
Telling yourself statements

49
00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:47.467
like it's okay, you will be okay

50
00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:50.436
can be helpful as a first step.

51
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:54.440
Sit with this step as long as you need

52
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.778
and as you calm down,

53
00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:01.814
try to be open to the choices
you have in front of you.

54
00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.752
What is the best way
to move forward from here?

55
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.390
The final letter in

56
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.693
stop the P stands for proceed

57
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.430
when you are ready
to close these moments of practice.

58
00:03:17.764 --> 00:03:20.833
You simply proceed
with taking the next step in your day

59
00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:23.603
with intentionality.

60
00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:27.707
Taking the next step in your day
from this place of strength,

61
00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:32.245
wisdom and presence.

62
00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.552
This stop practice will likely
come in handy

63
00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:42.121
many times during your days and weeks.

64
00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.258
It can help
whenever you're feeling distress,

65
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:49.162
and especially when you remember to pause
in the face

66
00:03:49.162 --> 00:03:52.398
of some stimulating event or situation.

67
00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.701
Creating a space

68
00:03:54.701 --> 00:04:00.106
for observing and taming your feelings
and accessing the resources within you.

69
00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:03.576
Stop.

70
00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.378
Take a breath.

71
00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:07.480
Observe what's going on in you.

72
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.749
Proceed with intention.
